Exercise 1: Creating Widgets
Imagine that you are developing a graphical interface and you need to create specific widgets for different operating systems. 
Defines a Button interface and a Checkbox interface with methods like render().

Then, implement concrete classes such as WindowsButton, WindowsCheckbox, MacButton, and MacCheckbox that implement these interfaces. 
Create a UIFactory interface with methods like createButton() and createCheckbox(). 
Implement two classes that implement this interface: WindowsUIFactory and MacUIFactory. 
Each of these classes must implement methods to create corresponding instances of buttons and checkboxes for their respective operating 
systems.
