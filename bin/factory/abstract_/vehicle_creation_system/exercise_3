Exercise 3: Vehicle Creation
Imagine you are developing a traffic simulation game and you need to create vehicles for different types of terrain. 
Defines a Car interface with methods like drive() and stop().

Then, implement concrete classes such as CityCar, CitySUV, OffRoadCar, and OffRoadSUV that implement this interface. 
Create a VehicleFactory interface with methods like createCar() and createSUV(). 
Implement two classes that implement this interface: CityVehicleFactory and OffRoadVehicleFactory. 
Each of these classes must implement the methods to create corresponding instances of cars and SUVs for their respective terrains.
